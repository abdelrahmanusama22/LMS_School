            <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>

            <h2> Elementary and Middle School</h2>

            <p>At ASD, we deliver a comprehensive American curriculum for our elementary and middle school students,
                firmly rooted in standards-based practices. Our approach to unit and course design reflects a commitment
                to innovation, with a focus on transitioning towards student-centered classrooms that prioritize learner
                agency.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Features:</h2>

            <p>Our curricular areas are regularly updated, placing learner outcomes at the forefront.
                Utilization of excellent text materials as primary sources of information.
                Teachers benefit from a wealth of supplementary resources, including our exceptional library.
                Mathematics

                Aligned with the American Common Core State Standards, our mathematics program challenges students to
                comprehend mathematical concepts using models, visuals, and clear explanations of their thought
                processes. Emphasizing the "why" of mathematics, the program fosters understanding over rote
                memorization of procedures or algorithms.</p>

            <h2><b> English Language Arts</b></h2>

            <P> Following the American Common Core State Standards, our language arts program equips students with the
                skills savvy readers and writers possess. Engaging in meaningful activities, students practice essential
                skills to tackle a diverse array of texts. They immerse themselves in the writing process, crafting
                pieces with a clear purpose for a specific audience.</P>

            <h2> <b> Science</b></h2>

            <p> Guided by the NGSS Framework, our science education seeks to inspire 21st-century students to be
                scientifically literate. The framework adopts a three-dimensional approach, integrating Disciplinary
                Core Ideas, Crosscutting Concepts, and Engineering. Departing from rote memorization, our focus is on
                cultivating curiosity, pushing creative boundaries, and exploring connections across the domains of
                science.</p>

            <h2> Social Studies</h2>

            <p> Utilizing the C3 Framework, our Social Studies program is forward-looking, emphasizing applicable skills
                and deep dives into relevant topics. Students, guided by the four dimensions of C3, become responsible
                citizens of the 21st century - adept problem-solvers in a rapidly changing world.</p>

            <h2> Physical Education </h2>

            <p> Following SHAPE America standards, our physical education program offers a planned, sequential, K-12
                standards-based curriculum. It is designed to develop motor skills, knowledge, and behaviors for active
                living, physical fitness, sportsmanship, self-efficacy, and emotional intelligence.</P>

            <h2>Music</h2>

            <p>Delivered through the Core Arts Standards, our music education focuses on creating, performing, and
                responding. Students engage in creating compositions, present musical work through instrumental and
                vocal performance, and analyze and interpret the intent and meaning in artistic work.</P>

            <h2> Visual Arts</h2>

            <p>Aligned with the Core Arts Standards, our art education emphasizes creating, producing, and connecting.
                Students refine artistic work, convey meaning through producing artistic work, and relate artistic ideas
                to external contexts.</p>

            <h2> Global Languages</h2>

            <p> Guided by the ACTFL Standards, our global language education provides a framework for diverse students
                to learn reading, writing, and communication in a foreign language in a safe, fun, and responsive
                environment.</p>

            <h2> Technology</h2>

            <p> Interpreting technology as a natural and essential part of everyday school life, our vision focuses on
                an integrated learning approach. It is an instructional strategy embedded in the curriculum, empowering
                students to pursue purposeful learning experiences and develop critical thinking skills.</p>

            <h2> Learning Support</h2>

            <p>Following the WIDA and Common Core State Standards, the Learning Support team creates tailored learning
                opportunities for culturally and linguistically diverse elementary and middle school students, ensuring
                access to all academic content.</p>

            <h2> Specialist Subjects</h2>

            <p>Elementary specialists include art, physical education, general music, Arabic, and library skills.
                Middle School students may select art, band, choir, and other electives based on the expertise and
                experience of our faculty.</p>

            <h2>High School</h2>

            <p>ASD's high school offers three distinct programs of study: the American curriculum college-preparatory
                program, the Advanced Placement program, and the full IB Diploma Programme. Each program provides a
                rigorous academic experience, emphasizing character development, global-mindedness, and an international
                perspective.</p>

            <h2> International Baccalaureate (IB)</h2>

            <p>The IB Diploma Programme, started in 1968, offers a holistic two-year program incorporating six courses
                of study and three core courses. These core courses, including Theory of Knowledge, a 4,000-word
                extended essay, and a program of creativity, activity, and service (CAS), aim to provide a broad
                spectrum of coursework with high academic rigor.</p>

            <h2> AP Capstone Program</h2>

            <p> Initiated in 2014, the AP Capstone program, developed by the College Board, enhances college readiness
                and critical thinking skills. Students earn an AP Capstone diploma by completing four AP courses along
                with required courses, AP Seminar and AP Research.</p>

            <p> Both the IB Diploma Programme and the AP Capstone program receive the “most demanding” classification
                from university admissions departments.</p>

            <p> Subjects offered at the high school level include English, math, science, social studies, global
                languages, physical education, fine arts, technology, health, and electives. To graduate from ASD, each
                student must be enrolled in 16 semester classes with a minimum total credit of 24.0 (recommended 27.5).
            </p>

            <p>A mandatory course for all students is "Arabic Culture," fulfilling the Saudi Ministry of Education's
                requirement to provide conversational Arabic and designated cultural topics promoting awareness of the
                host country. </p>
